# Bossey Dance Crew webpage
## Webpage of the local dance crew

### **_Introduction_**
Bossey DC is an local dance crew in Aalborg with amazing dancers.

### **_Project itself_** 
During the Frontend modul I wanted to test my knowledge synchronously with the course. I chosed the dance crew because they had many awesome, good quality pictures which could be used.

 ### **_Used Technologies_**
 1. HTML
 2. CSS
 3. JavaScript

**Aim of the Project**
To make a nice webpage with some basic information about the crew members and their dance projects.

**Challenges within the Project**

1. How to put the awesome, good-quality pictures to the page without slowing down the page itself.
2. Using grid and flexboxes - sometimes was challenging.
3. Adding some JavaScript features (for example text on the images) was pretty hard that time.

## **_What have I learned_**
Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a nice and responsive page.
